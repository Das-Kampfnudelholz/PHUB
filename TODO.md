# TODO

TODO for 4.2:
- [ ] Fix threaded downloader
- [ ] Lighter feed parsing
- [x] An actual good logo
- [ ] Handle multiple images sources

Possible PH features to add:
- [ ] Recommended users
- [ ] RSS flux (would require bs4 for XML parsing) and db download

And i guess that's it. I don't see any other feature to add that would be useful to use
in an API (unless you have specific requests).
