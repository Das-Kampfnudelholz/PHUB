# TODO

TODO for 4.2:
- [x] An actual good logo
- [ ] Fix threaded downloader
- [ ] Lighter feed parsing
- [ ] Handle multiple images sources
- [ ] Support even more long term usage
- [ ] Better user bio/stuff parsing


Possible PH features to add:
- [ ] Recommended users
- [ ] RSS flux (would require bs4 for XML parsing) and db download

And i guess that's it. I don't see any other feature to add that would be useful to use
in an API (unless you have specific requests).
