# TODO

TODO for 4.2:
- [x] An actual good logo
- [x] Fix threaded downloader
- [x] Account long term usage
- [x] Handle multiple images sources
- [x] Implement default user avatar
- [ ] Lighter feed parsing

Possible PH features to add:
- [ ] Recommended users
- [x] RSS flux (very bare-bone)

And i guess that's it. I don't see any other feature to add that would be useful to use
in an API (unless you have specific requests).
